This is a modification of the bantipai_bottom. In this there are slots and one mounting screw-hole for each of the four [motor driver](http://www.nex-robotics.com/products/motor-drivers/dc-motor-drivers/hercules-series-motor-drivers/hercules-lite-6v-36v-8amp-motor-driver.html)\
In this, the motor drivers are situated at right angles to each other and equidistant to the eyfi-mega, which is placed at the center.
However, since this PCB is compact, the motor driver is won't be completely inside the board, some part of it would be peeking outside, and thus it is imperative to make
additional changes(mounting holes) on the acrylic sheet on which the PCB is to be mounted.
